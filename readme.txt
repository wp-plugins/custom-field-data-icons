Custom Field Data Icons is a lightweight plugin that will display custom field data with icons on front page. It requires Classipress to be installed.

== Description ==

With this plugin you will be able to show <a href="https://www.appthemes.com/themes/classipress/?aid=26553" target="_blank">Classipress</a> custom fields with icons on front page when listing ads. Some data can be important to the user, but users always have to click on an ad to see if specifications meet their expectations. And that can slow down your site. That's why I decided to create <a href="http://easycpmods.com">Custom Field Data Icons</a> plugin.

When you setup a <a href="https://www.appthemes.com/themes/classipress/?aid=26553" target="_blank">Classipress</a> theme, you will probable use your own custom fields that are important for your site. This fields are used then mostly for searching and also displaying data.

With this plugin you will put custom fields with icons on front page, so the users can quickly see main specifications of the items being sold when scrolling trough ads.

You can see a working site with this functionality <a href=http://www.slosurf.com">here<a/>.
